# UltimateDRM
DRM Library for Windows (x64) in C++

** This project was started on July 19, 2025, and might not have many files yet  
** There is no such thing as an 'uncrackable DRM' - any code or binaries run on a client machine can be tampered with enough effort  

## Features:  
-Memory protections  
-Licensing  
-Integrity checks  
-...More coming soon  

## How to use:  
The project is a static library (.lib) which you can include in your C++ project, along with the `DRM.hpp` header file. You can then create a `DRM` class object and call the `Protect` function.
